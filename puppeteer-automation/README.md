# Puppeteer Automation Scripts

A collection of browser automation scripts built with Puppeteer, demonstrating web scraping and e-commerce interaction capabilities. These projects highlight my skills in JavaScript, automation, and problem-solving as a budding software and DevOps engineer.

## Overview

This repository contains two scripts:
1. **`FormFilling.js`**: Automates filling and submitting a credit card form on a test website.
2. **`OrderIphone.js`**: Simulates adding an iPhone 16 to a cart and completing the checkout process on Apple's website.

These projects showcase my ability to:
- Write clean, modular JavaScript code.
- Leverage Puppeteer for browser automation.
- Implement stealth techniques to bypass bot detection.
- Handle real-world web interactions with error handling and debugging.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18 or higher
- **Google Chrome**: Installed and accessible (path specified in scripts)
- **npm**: For dependency management

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
