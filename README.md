# Puppeteer Automation Scripts

A collection of browser automation scripts built with Puppeteer, demonstrating web scraping and e-commerce interaction capabilities. These projects highlight my skills in JavaScript, automation, and problem-solving as a budding software and DevOps engineer.

## Overview

This repository contains two scripts:
1. **`FormFilling.js`**: Automates filling and submitting a credit card form on a test website.
2. **`OrderIphone.js`**: Simulates adding an iPhone 16 to a cart and completing the checkout process on Apple's website.

These projects showcase my ability to:
- Write clean, modular JavaScript code.
- Leverage Puppeteer for browser automation.
- Implement stealth techniques to bypass bot detection.
- Handle real-world web interactions with error handling and debugging.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18 or higher
- **Google Chrome**: Installed and accessible (path specified in scripts)
- **npm**: For dependency management

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhavyadabas/puppeteer-automation.git
   cd puppeteer-automation

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ````bash
   npm install

3. **Update Executable Path**: Edit executablePath in both scripts to match your Chrome installation:
      macOS: /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome
      Windows: C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe
      Linux: /usr/bin/google-chrome

4. **Dependencies**
      puppeteer-core: Core automation library.
      puppeteer-extra: Extends Puppeteer with plugins.
      puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth: Evades bot detection.
      See package.json for versions.

5. **Notes**
      Headless Mode: Set to false for visibility; switch to true for background runs.
      Timeouts: Tuned for reliability; adjust for network conditions.
      Error Handling: Logs and screenshots (e.g., after_add_to_cart.png) aid debugging.

6. **License**
      Licensed under the ISC License - see package.json for details.
